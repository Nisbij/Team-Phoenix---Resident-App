# Team-Phoenix---Flood-Detection
This Web App uses location input to fetch the corresponding satellite imagery, which it the fetches to a machine learning algorithm that is able to identify the flooded areas. It also uses the population density per sq km to identify the number of people affected by the floods and their distribution. Various insights such as the severity of flood, personnel required etc will also be shown. This Web app is intended to help the NDRF(National Disaster Response Force) to better understand the reality of the flooding and help them be informed, so that they can make the correct crucial decisions at the time of tragedy. This web App would also be available for the general population to use, so they can have nuanced information, and keep themselves safe by making informed decisions.
